# Course Management System - Unified Course Handling

## Issue Fixes

1. **Fixed `isStandalone` Not Defined Error**

   - Removed standalone course concept entirely
   - All courses now use the same unified workflow
   - Added proper imports at the top of controller files

2. **N/A Faculty Approach**

   - Created a special "N/A" faculty for courses without a specific faculty
   - All courses are now stored in faculty collections (either real faculty or N/A)
   - This ensures consistent data structure for all courses

3. **Consistent Course Handling**
   - All course creation uses the same endpoint: `/api/admin/courses`
   - Faculty and Institute fields are always required (with N/A options when needed)
   - All course details pages use the same data structure

## Implementation Details

1. **Backend Changes**

   - Added proper model imports in controllers
   - Created N/A faculty if it doesn't exist
   - Updated course controller to use N/A faculty instead of standalone courses
   - Modified getCoursesByPaper to include N/A faculty courses

2. **Frontend Changes**
   - Improved form validation
   - Faculty and Institute fields properly marked as required
   - Consistent handling of N/A options
   - Updated error messages to guide user appropriately

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Data Model**

   - One consistent approach for all courses
   - No special handling for different course types
   - Better maintainability

2. **Improved User Experience**

   - Clear guidance on required fields
   - Consistent display of courses
   - More reliable course management

3. **Error Prevention**
   - Eliminated errors from missing variables
   - More robust validation
   - Consistent data structure

All courses now follow the same creation, storage, and display logic, ensuring reliable operation regardless of whether they have a specific faculty assigned or use the N/A faculty option.
