# Course Creation Fix - Debug and Testing Tools

## Problem Identified

When adding courses, the application returns a 500 Internal Server Error. There's not enough information to diagnose the root cause without additional debugging tools.

## Solution Approach

Rather than just making changes to the main endpoint, we've created comprehensive debugging tools to help identify and fix the issue:

1. **Debug Endpoints**: Created separate endpoints specifically for testing course creation
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added detailed error handling for common issues
3. **Browser-Based Testing Tool**: Created a simple HTML tool for testing the API without the full app
4. **Detailed Logging**: Added verbose logging of all request details

## Files Modified

### 1. Server Routes

Created a new debug routes file: `server/src/routes/debug-courses.routes.js`

- `/api/debug/courses/test` - Simple test endpoint without file upload
- `/api/debug/courses` - Test endpoint with local file storage

### 2. Main App.js

- Added more detailed error handling and logging
- Mounted debug routes
- Enhanced Multer error reporting
- Added specific handling for validation errors

### 3. Testing Tool

Created `client/public/course-creation-test.html`:

- Simple browser-based tool for testing all endpoints
- No authentication required for easy testing
- Provides detailed feedback from each endpoint

## How to Test

1. Deploy the changes using `deploy-course-fix.bat`
2. Navigate to `https://www.academywale.com/course-creation-test.html`
3. Use the testing tool to try each endpoint:
   - Simple Test: Basic API connectivity without file upload
   - Debug Endpoint: Test file upload with local storage
   - Main Endpoint: Test the actual course creation endpoint

## Expected Results

- The tool will provide detailed error messages
- Server logs will show exactly what's happening with each request
- With this information, we can precisely identify where the course creation process is failing

## Next Steps

After diagnosing the exact issue using these tools:

1. Fix the specific problem in the course creation logic
2. Remove the debug endpoints in production
3. Streamline the error handling for production use
