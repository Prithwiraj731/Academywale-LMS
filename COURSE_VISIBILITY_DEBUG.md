# Course Visibility Fix - Debug Guide

## Problem

Courses are being saved to MongoDB correctly from the admin panel, but they're not appearing on the paper detail pages in the browser. Users see "No courses available for this paper yet. Check back later."

## Solution Applied

The issue was caused by data type inconsistencies between how courses are saved and how they're filtered:

1. **Data Normalization**: Enhanced both creation endpoints to normalize:

   - `category` → uppercase (e.g., "CA", "CMA")
   - `subcategory` → lowercase (e.g., "foundation", "inter", "final")
   - `paperId` → string format for consistent matching

2. **Enhanced Filtering**: Added multiple fallback search mechanisms to handle edge cases

3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed debug logs to track course creation and retrieval

## Files Modified

### 1. `/server/src/controllers/course.controller.js`

- Added `normalizeCourseData()` function
- Enhanced `getCoursesByPaper()` with multiple fallback searches
- Added comprehensive debug logging

### 2. `/server/app.js`

- Fixed main course creation endpoint `/api/admin/courses`
- Added proper data normalization for both faculty and standalone courses
- Added debug logging for course creation

## Debug Tools

### 1. Debug Script: `debug_course_visibility.js`

Run this when the server is running to test course visibility:

```bash
# Install node-fetch if not already installed
npm install node-fetch

# Run the debug script
node debug_course_visibility.js
```

This script will:

- Test all paper detail endpoints
- Show what courses exist in the database
- Create a test course and verify it appears
- Provide detailed diagnostic information

### 2. Debug Endpoints

Access these URLs when the server is running:

- **Course Debug**: `http://localhost:3000/api/courses/debug`
  Shows all courses with their metadata
- **Simple Test**: `http://localhost:3000/api/courses/simple-test`
  Quick overview of course counts and samples
- **All Courses**: `http://localhost:3000/api/courses/all`
  Returns all courses in the system

### 3. Test Specific Papers

Test specific paper endpoints directly:

- `http://localhost:3000/api/courses/CA/foundation/1`
- `http://localhost:3000/api/courses/CA/inter/1`
- `http://localhost:3000/api/courses/CA/final/1`
- `http://localhost:3000/api/courses/CMA/foundation/1`

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Start the server and client** (as you normally do)

2. **Check existing courses**:

   ```bash
   node debug_course_visibility.js
   ```

3. **Create a new course** via the admin panel

4. **Verify it appears** on the appropriate paper detail page

5. **Check debug logs** in the server console for detailed information

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Course Creation**: Courses created via admin panel should have properly normalized data
2. **Course Retrieval**: Paper detail pages should find courses using multiple search strategies
3. **Debug Logs**: Detailed logs should help identify any remaining issues

## Troubleshooting

If courses still don't appear:

1. **Check server logs** for detailed debugging information
2. **Run the debug script** to see what courses exist and their data format
3. **Verify admin panel form** is sending correct category/subcategory/paperId values
4. **Check for JavaScript errors** in browser console

## Key Changes Summary

- ✅ Fixed data normalization during course creation
- ✅ Enhanced course filtering with fallback searches
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging
- ✅ Created debug tools for testing
- ✅ Ensured both faculty and standalone courses work correctly

The system now handles data inconsistencies gracefully and provides detailed logging to help diagnose any future issues.
