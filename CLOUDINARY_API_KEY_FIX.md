# Cloudinary API Key Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. Old Cloudinary API key (`959547171781827`) was still being used in `app-working-fix.js`
2. Faculty routes were defined in `faculty.routes.js` but not properly mounted in `app.js`
3. Duplicate faculty creation route existed in `app.js` alongside the modular routes

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Cloudinary Configuration

- Removed hardcoded Cloudinary config in `app-working-fix.js` with old API key
- Updated to use proper import from `./src/config/cloudinary.config.js`
- Verified that all files now reference the correct API key (`367882575567196`)

### 2. Fixed Route Mounting

- Added proper mounting of faculty routes in `app.js`:
  ```javascript
  // Mount faculty routes
  const facultyRoutes = require("./src/routes/faculty.routes.js");
  app.use("/", facultyRoutes);
  ```
- Removed duplicate faculty creation endpoint from `app.js` to prevent conflicts

### 3. Validated Configuration Files

- Confirmed `cloudinary.config.js` has proper API credentials
- Confirmed `cloudinary-fresh.config.js` also has correct API credentials
- Verified no other files reference the old API key

## Expected Results

1. Faculty creation endpoint should now work correctly
2. No more "Unknown API key" errors when adding faculty
3. All routes are properly modularized for better code maintenance
4. Cloudinary integration should function properly for file uploads

## Deployment

- Created `deploy-cloudinary-fix.bat` deployment script
- Changes should be deployed to Render automatically after Git push

## Testing Steps

1. Run the deployment script
2. Once deployed, test faculty creation at https://academywale.com/admin/faculty
3. Verify that images upload correctly and no API key errors appear
4. Verify that created faculty members appear in faculty listing page
