# Standalone Course Migration Summary

## Overview

All standalone courses have been migrated to a unified course system. Instead of having courses in two separate collections (`Faculty` and `Course`), all courses are now stored within the `Faculty` collection, with general courses stored under an "N/A" faculty.

## Changes Made

1. **Backend Changes**:

   - Removed `Course.model.js` imports from controllers
   - Updated `courseDetail.controller.js` to only look for courses within faculties
   - Updated `course.controller.js` to remove all standalone references
   - Redirected all standalone course API routes to use the unified system
   - Removed isStandalone flags from the code

2. **Compatibility Layer**:

   - Modified `standaloneCourse.routes.js` to act as a compatibility layer
   - All legacy standalone endpoints now redirect to their unified counterparts
   - Old API clients will continue to work without modification

3. **Data Migration**:
   - Created `migrate-standalone-courses.js` script to move any remaining standalone courses to the N/A faculty
   - Courses are properly attributed to "N/A" faculty and can be managed through the admin panel

## How Courses Are Now Handled

- **Regular Faculty Courses**: Stored within the respective faculty's `courses` array
- **General Courses (previously "standalone")**: Stored in the "N/A" faculty's `courses` array
- **All Course Views**: Display faculty information (or "N/A" if none)
- **Admin Panel**: Faculty/Institute selection is required, with "N/A" as an option

## APIs Modified

1. `/api/courses/standalone` → Now returns courses from the "N/A" faculty
2. `/api/courses/all` → Now returns courses from all faculties (including "N/A" faculty)
3. `/api/courses/:id` → Now finds courses in all faculties
4. `/api/admin/courses/standalone` (POST) → Now creates course under "N/A" faculty
5. `/api/admin/courses/standalone/:id` (PUT/DELETE) → Now modifies course in correct faculty

## How to Run the Migration

If you need to migrate any remaining standalone courses, run:

```bash
node migrate-standalone-courses.js
```

This will:

1. Find all standalone courses in the `Course` collection
2. Add them to the "N/A" faculty in the `Faculty` collection
3. Delete the original standalone courses from the `Course` collection

## Verification

To verify the migration was successful:

1. Check the admin panel to ensure all courses appear correctly
2. Verify that course details pages show properly for all courses
3. Test course creation with "N/A" faculty selection
4. Confirm course deletion works properly

## Benefits

- Simplified codebase with a single source of truth for all courses
- Consistent API responses for all course types
- Easier maintenance and future feature development
- More reliable course filtering and searching
