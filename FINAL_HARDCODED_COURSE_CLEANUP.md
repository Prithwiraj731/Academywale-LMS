# Final Hardcoded Course Cleanup

This document summarizes the final cleanup of hardcoded course references and standalone course logic from the AcademyWale system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed "includeStandalone" Parameter from API URLs

- Removed the `includeStandalone=true` parameter from all API URL calls in:
  - `CAFoundationPaperDetailPage.jsx`
  - `CMAFoundationPaperDetailPage.jsx`
  - `CMAInterPaperDetailPage.jsx`
  - `CMAFinalPaperDetailPage.jsx`

### 2. Removed Console Logging of Standalone Courses

- Removed the console logging of standalone courses count in all detail pages:
  ```javascript
  console.log(
    "Standalone courses:",
    data.courses.filter((c) => c.isStandalone).length || 0
  );
  ```

### 3. Removed isStandalone UI Conditionals

- Removed conditional rendering based on `course.isStandalone` in:
  - `CMAInterPaperDetailPage.jsx`
  - `CMAFinalPaperDetailPage.jsx`
- Replaced with a simple faculty display:
  ```javascript
  <div className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2 text-center">
    Faculty: {course.facultyName}
  </div>
  ```

### 4. Updated Comments and Console Logs

- Updated console log messages and comments to remove mentions of "standalone" and "includeStandalone"
- Changed comments like "Only use URLs with includeStandalone=true" to "Try different URL variations"

### 5. Updated Warning Messages in Admin Components

- Updated the warning message in `DeleteAllCoursesButton.jsx` to remove mentions of "standalone and faculty courses"

## Summary

All references to standalone courses have been removed from the frontend code. The system now exclusively operates with faculty-based courses, where:

1. Faculty is required for all courses
2. Institute is optional
3. No hardcoded/mock courses are displayed
4. Only admin-created courses are visible to users

The UI has been updated to reflect this change, removing any "Standalone Course" badges or special handling for standalone courses.

These changes complete the transition to a faculty-only course management system without any hardcoded courses or fallback logic.
