# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Academywale LMS platform is experiencing a critical issue where users cannot view course details. When users click "View Details" on any course, the system returns a "Course not found" error with a 404 HTTP response. The error specifically shows "Course not found: cma-final-test5mP" indicating a mismatch between the course ID being requested and what exists in the database. This issue prevents users from accessing essential course information, severely impacting the user experience and potentially affecting sales conversions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student browsing courses, I want to click "View Details" on any course and successfully view the course information, so that I can make informed decisions about course purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "View Details" on any course THEN the system SHALL successfully retrieve and display the course details
2. WHEN the system receives a course details request THEN it SHALL return a 200 HTTP status code with valid course data
3. WHEN a course ID is passed to the API THEN the system SHALL correctly match it against the database records
4. IF a course exists in the database THEN the system SHALL return all relevant course information including title, description, pricing, and metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the course lookup mechanism to handle various course ID formats consistently, so that all courses remain accessible regardless of how they were created or stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a course lookup request THEN it SHALL handle both original course IDs and any transformed/encoded versions
2. WHEN course IDs contain special characters or formatting THEN the system SHALL properly decode and match them
3. WHEN multiple course ID formats exist THEN the system SHALL attempt lookup using all possible variations
4. IF a course ID transformation occurs during storage THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for lookups

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for course lookup failures, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a course lookup fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the attempted lookup including the requested ID and search parameters
2. WHEN the system cannot find a course THEN it SHALL return a meaningful error message that helps identify the root cause
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL log the actual query parameters and results for debugging
4. IF multiple lookup strategies are attempted THEN the system SHALL log each attempt and its outcome

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the platform, I want the course details page to load quickly and reliably, so that I can efficiently browse available courses without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a course details request is made THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds under normal load
2. WHEN the course details API is called THEN it SHALL return consistent data structure regardless of course type
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry mechanisms
4. IF the primary lookup method fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative lookup strategies before returning an error
