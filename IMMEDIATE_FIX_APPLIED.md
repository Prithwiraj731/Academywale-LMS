## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX APPLIED - Course Creation Fix

### What was wrong:

- Your frontend was trying to use `/api/admin/courses/new` for faculty courses
- Your deployed backend on Render only has `/api/admin/courses/standalone`
- This caused 404 errors when creating faculty-based courses

### What I fixed:

1. **Updated AdminDashboard.jsx** to use `/api/admin/courses/standalone` for ALL course types
2. **Added `isStandalone` field** to FormData so backend knows the course type
3. **Your deployed backend already supports both types** through the same endpoint

### Changes Made:

```javascript
// OLD (causing 404):
const apiEndpoint = courseForm.isStandalone
  ? `${API_URL}/api/admin/courses/standalone`
  : `${API_URL}/api/admin/courses/new`; // ❌ This doesn't exist

// NEW (working):
const apiEndpoint = `${API_URL}/api/admin/courses/standalone`; // ✅ This exists
```

### Your endpoint analysis:

- ✅ `/api/admin/courses/standalone` - EXISTS and handles both course types
- ❌ `/api/admin/courses/new` - DOES NOT EXIST on your deployed backend
- ❌ `/api/admin/courses` - DOES NOT EXIST on your deployed backend

### Test Now:

1. Go to your deployed site admin dashboard
2. Try creating both standalone and faculty-based courses
3. Both should now work without 404 errors

The fix is deployed and ready to test!
