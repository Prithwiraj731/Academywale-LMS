# Course Mode Validation Fix

## Problem Fixed

The system was rejecting course creation with the error:

```
"Live at Home With Hard Copy" is not a valid enum value for path `mode`.
```

This was happening because the Faculty model's course schema had a restricted list of allowed mode values:

- Live Watching
- Recorded Videos

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Faculty Schema Update

We expanded the allowed modes in the `CourseSchema` to include:

- Live Watching
- Recorded Videos
- Live at Home With Hard Copy
- Self Study

```javascript
mode: { type: String, enum: ['Live Watching', 'Recorded Videos', 'Live at Home With Hard Copy', 'Self Study'] },
```

### 2. Course Validation Utility

We created a utility function `validateCourseMode` that:

- Checks if the mode is valid
- Automatically fixes invalid modes to "Live Watching"

### 3. Applied Mode Validation to All Endpoints

We updated all course creation endpoints to use the validation utility:

- `/api/admin/courses` (main endpoint)
- `/api/admin/courses/new` (secondary endpoint)
- `/api/admin/courses/faculty` (faculty-specific endpoint)
- `/api/admin/courses/controller` (controller-based endpoint)

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

We added special handling for validation errors in the global error handler:

- Detects mode validation errors
- Provides helpful suggestions about valid modes
- Returns a user-friendly error message

## What to Expect

When adding a course with the mode "Live at Home With Hard Copy":

- The system will accept it without validation errors
- The course will be created successfully

If an unsupported mode is used:

- The system will automatically set it to "Live Watching"
- The course will still be created successfully

## Testing

The best way to test this is to:

1. Go to the admin interface
2. Try to create a course with mode "Live at Home With Hard Copy"
3. Verify it's created successfully
