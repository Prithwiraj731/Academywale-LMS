## Key Changes

### 1. Emergency Override Strategy

We're now forcibly setting the Cloudinary configuration at the very start of the application, before any other code runs. This ensures that regardless of environment variables or other configurations, the correct API key will be used.

### 2. Environment Variable Handling

The emergency fix explicitly deletes any existing Cloudinary environment variables to prevent them from overriding our hardcoded configuration.

### 3. Diagnostic Logging

Added verbose logging to help troubleshoot:

- When configuration is applied
- What cloud name and API key are being used

## Deployment Instructions

1. Run `deploy-cloudinary-fix.bat`
2. Monitor deployment on Render
3. Look for "EMERGENCY CLOUDINARY CONFIG APPLIED!" in logs
4. Test faculty creation functionality
5. If still having issues, follow manual fix steps in CLOUDINARY-EMERGENCY-FIX.md

## Next Steps

Once this fix is verified working:

1. Clean up redundant configuration files
2. Implement proper environment variable handling
3. Remove hardcoded API keys from all files
4. Set up proper secrets management in Render
